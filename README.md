# Sprint 7 project

The purpose of this project for a student to show their understanding of
Javascript by creating API tests for GET, POST, PUT and DELETE. And to show 
that they can create a README.md file.

Visual Studio Code was used for creating and running the tests. Git and GitHub
was used to update the files that were locally stored on the students machine 
to a remote repository for the review to access.

If you are wanting to test all of the test files simultaneously you can access
terminal from Visual Studio Code and run the command "npx jest". This will run
all for files simultaneously that contain the created tests.

If you are wanting to run each test file individualy than in the terminalyou 
will need to run "npx jest filename" in order to run a single file. For 
example, if you want to just run the tests for the getHandlers.test.js file 
than you will need to enter "npx jest getHandlers.test.js" in the terminal 
and it will than run just that file.
